# I FINALLY UPDATED IT
This is Pong3D. A remake of an old project. It is a very simple 3D Pong game made in Python.

## Setup and Play
This game is written in Python. So you need the latest Python Interpreter installed.

### Dependencies
At the repository's directory, install all the necessary dependencies with `pip`:
```console

```

### Play
To play Pong3D, just run the Python script at the `src` folder:

## Old version
You can also play the old version of the game. It's source code is in the [`ordsrc` folder](./oldsrc/) inside the repository.
